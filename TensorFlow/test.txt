John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and 
refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of 
shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the
stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. 
There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from
 motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.
As with the previous 2 installments, John Wick 3 is where Keanu Reeves is at home. 
This role was just made for him, and watching him stand toe to toe with powerhouses like Halle Berry, Ian McShane, 
Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Huston, not only shows how good he is as an action star, but as an actor in general.
He hasn't been given a role this good since the Matrix, but those movies never showed how good he was just at acting. 
He sells this movie.
The supporting cast is all amazing, and I loved how they left their character's hanging, giving us hope of seeing 
them in future installments. I also loved how more in-depth the movie spent on world-building. The way it brings in 
different cultures into this assassin guild is done very well.
John Wick 3 is an amazing action movie that never loses its steam throughout, and its 2 hour run times flies past, 
because of non-stop action that is directed and choreographed to perfection. I can't wait to see if they manage to pull 
off the 4th like they did here.
Less than an hour after the events of the second film, former hitman John Wick is now a marked man and on the run in 
Manhattan, with his dog. After the unsanctioned killing of crime lord and new member of the High Table 
Santino D'Antonio in the New York City Continental, John is declared "excommunicado" by the Table and a $14 million 
bounty is placed on his head that rises each hour. On the run from numerous assassins, John visits the New York Public 
Library and retrieves a crucifix necklace and a "marker" medallion from a secret cache in a book. He visits the 
Director, the head of the Ruska Roma, a crime organisation he once belonged to, and who refers to him by his birth 
name: Jardani Jovonovich. She accepts the crucifix as a "ticket" for safe passage to Casablanca, Morocco.
Meanwhile, an Adjudicator of the High Table meets with Winston, the manager of the New York City Continental, and the 
Bowery King, the leader of a network of vagrants. The Adjudicator admonishes both for helping John in the Santino 
killing and aftermath, and both are given seven days to give up their offices. Soon afterward, the Adjudicator hires 
Zero, a Japanese assassin. They find the Director, whose hands are pierced by Zero as punishment for helping John.
In Casablanca, John meets Sofia, a former friend and the manager of the Moroccan Continental. He presents his marker 
and asks Sofia to honor it by directing him to the Elder, the only person known to be above the High Table, so that he 
can request to have his bounty rescinded. Sofia takes him to meet Berrada, her former boss, who now runs the mint that 
manufactures the gold coins of the assassins. Berrada tells John that he may find the Elder by wandering through the 
desert until he cannot walk any longer. In exchange, Berrada asks for one of Sofia's dogs; when Sofia refuses, 
he shoots the dog (who is wearing a bulletproof vest at the time, so is unharmed). In retaliation, Sofia shoots and 
wounds Berrada, and the duo fight their way out of the kasbah and flee into the desert. Having fulfilled her marker, 
Sofia leaves John in the desert. Meanwhile, the Adjudicator, accompanied by Zero, confronts the Bowery King because 
he did not agree to leave his position after seven days. As penance for assisting Wick previously with seven bullets, 
Zero maims the Bowery King with seven cuts.
In the desert, John collapses from exhaustion but is found and brought to the Elder. John says that he is desperate to 
live on to "earn" the memory of the love he once had with his wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John on condition that 
he assassinate Winston and continue to work for the High Table until his death. To show his commitment, John severs his 
ring finger and offers his wedding ring to the Elder. John arrives back in New York City and is pursued by Zero's men. 
Zero nearly kills John before his pursuit is halted as they arrive at the New York City Continental. Charon, the 
hotel's concierge, reminds Zero that no "business" shall be conducted on hotel property, lest he be declared 
excommunicado himself. John is allowed to meet with Winston, who encourages John not to die as an enslaved killer but 
as a man who loved, and was loved by, his wife.
The Adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to give up his office, and John refuses to kill Winston. As a consequence, 
the Adjudicator "deconsecrates" the New York City Continental, revoking its protected neutral ground status. 
The Adjudicator notifies Zero and sends heavily-armed and armored High Table enforcers as backup. Winston furnishes 
John with weapons from the hotel, and alongside Charon and other hotel staff, John defends the Continental from the 
enforcers. John is subsequently ambushed by Zero and his students. John kills all but two students, and then fatally 
wounds Zero.
The Adjudicator negotiates a parley with Winston, who explains the rebellion as a "show of strength" and offers penance
to the High Table. John arrives, and when the Adjudicator identifies him as a threat to the negotiation, Winston shoots 
John repeatedly in the torso, causing John to fall off of the Continental's roof. The New York City Continental returns 
to operation and is "reconsecrated", but the Adjudicator informs Winston that John's body has disappeared, and that he 
remains a threat for both of them. Meanwhile, a seriously injured John and his dog are delivered to a now 
heavily-scarred Bowery King.
He tells John that he has had enough of the High Table and will be rising against them; 
John agrees to join him in his efforts.
